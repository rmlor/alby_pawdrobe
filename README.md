Welcome to Alby's Pawdrobe!

This project was created as part of OSU's CS340 course.

Our website was created from the idea of a pet company that creates custom clothing for dogs. Alby's Pawdrobe employees uses this website to manage their database and improve business processes. With this website, the company can store information about customers, addresses, dogs, orders, and products.

Ruth Lor and Nhu Dang have finished this project as of 12/7/2024.
